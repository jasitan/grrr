<h3>We are currently in our 3rd Grading and we are being taught a lot of valuable things.Although there are a lot of numbers, it is still fun.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quadratic Inequalities.A quadratic inequality is an equation of second degree that uses an inequality sign instead of an equal sign. Examples of quadratic inequalities are: x2 – 6x – 16 ≤ 0, 2x2 – 11x + 12 > 0, x2 + 4 > 0, x2 – 3x + 2 ≤ 0 etc. 
  <li>Sum and Product of the Roots. The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the second term, divided by the leading co
efficient. The product of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the constant term (the third term), divided by the leading coefficient.
  <li> Direct variation exists between any two variables when one quantity is directly dependent on the other i.e. if one quantity increases with respect to the other quantity and vice versa. It is the relationship between two variables where one of the variables is a constant multiple of the other.
