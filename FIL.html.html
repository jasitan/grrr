<b>Hello</b>, I'm currently in my 9th grade now! the last time I did this kind of output was when I was on the 8th grade.
Our Filipino subject is a lot harder now.We learned about the two types of Japanese poems, the Tanka and Haiku. It has themes
which are Love, Nature and Change. Writing these kind of poems is fun, you can express a lot of ideas and feelings.
